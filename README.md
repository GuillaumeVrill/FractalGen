# FractalGen
A Fractal Generator for Android, created by Guillaume Vrilliaux using Android studio.
At the moment, it only draws a fractal tree when touching the screen. The idea was to manipulate Canvas in Android, and see how we could use it to draw simple fractals.

## Actual Functionnalities
- Generate a green fractal tree on the screen
- Generate a new one when you touch the screen

## Functionnalities to come
- An interface to chose the type of fractal you want to display (mandelbrot, fractal tree, [...])
- Customization of the existing fractals (e.g. adding leaves to the tree, thikness gesture for the trunk and the branches, [...])
- A page explaining what's a fractal and guiding you to some other projects or articles about it
