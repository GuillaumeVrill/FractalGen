# FractalGen
A Fractal example Generator for Android, created by Guillaume Vrilliaux using Android studio.
The idea was to manipulate Canvas in Android, and see how we could use it to draw simple fractals.

## Actual Functionnalities
- Access a page that explains why i decided to work on fractals and that give some web links to learn more about fractals (in french!)
- Fractal tree page: generate a tree on the screen (basically a fractal tree that i've modified) each time you touch the screen 
- Fractal Mandelbrot page: (black screen for now :next to come)
